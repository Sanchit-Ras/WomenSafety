# Mapping Women’s Safety: Predictive Analysis for Awareness

## Project Title
Mapping Women’s Safety: Predictive Analysis for Awareness

---

## Project Description
This project aims to enhance awareness of women’s safety by analyzing and visualizing crime data. By leveraging predictive analytics and interactive visualizations, the project highlights high-risk zones and trends in crimes against women, aiding policymakers and citizens in making informed decisions.

### Key Features
- Predictive analysis of crime data to identify future high-risk zones.
- Interactive Dash-based visualizations, including choropleth maps, bar charts, and line charts.
- Comparative crime trends and focus on high-risk areas.
- Easy-to-understand representation of data for public awareness.

### Technologies Used
- **Languages/Tools**: Python, Pandas, Dash, Folium, Geopandas, Random Forest Regressor
- **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Plotly
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn
- **Web Framework**: Dash
